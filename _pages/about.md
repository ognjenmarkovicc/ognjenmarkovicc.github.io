I obtained a physics PhD at Stanford University in the group of
[Monika Schleier-Smith](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/sslab). In my PhD
work, I designed and built a [platform](/projects/experimental_platform/) for quantum simulation and metrology. Currently, I am working as a postdoc in the group
of [Markus Greiner](https://greiner.physics.harvard.edu/) on [quantum simulation](/projects/dipolar_lattice/)
with magnetic atoms in an optical lattice. I have done my undergraduate studies
at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge where I have obtained my
BA and MSci ([Part III](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/students/teaching/current-courses/III_overview)) degrees in physics.
