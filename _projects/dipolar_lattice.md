The goal of my post-doctoral research at Harvard University is to understand complex physical models which can lead to a better understanding of materials and many-body quantum physics. In the Greiner lab at Harvard University, I have worked on completing and using an experimental system to examine a system of cold atoms on a lattice with novel capabilities. This work has led to the first observation of dipole-dipole interaction in lattice systems, while also showcasing a unique method for imaging single particles on a lattice.
The technical challenges in this project involved achieving single particle detection, finalizing the optical system for optical lattices, and making sure the experiment could perform reliably. I oversaw several improvements to the experiment which have led to scientific results; from understanding the physics behind the imaging process and implementing a technique that overcame low imaging performance, to improving the preparation of the initial cold state of the atoms. 
To that end, I have led integration between different existing experimental systems, such as the custom experiment control system written in C# and the Python data analysis suite.
