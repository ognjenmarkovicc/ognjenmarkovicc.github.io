The goal of this project was to demonstrate a technique to produce coherent interactions in a system of cold atoms. Coherent interactions are a prerequisite for both future measurement technology and studies of quantum many-body systems.

In this project, my team and I realized long-range ferromagnetic Ising interactions in a cold gas of cesium atoms by Rydberg dressing. I was involved in every stage of the project, from troubleshooting and calibration to collecting and analyzing data. Our results highlighted the power of optical addressing for achieving local and dynamical control of quantum interactions, enabling future applications in quantum optimization and the creation of large, entangled quantum states.
