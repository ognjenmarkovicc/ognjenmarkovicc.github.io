For my PhD in the Stanford University Physics Department, I worked on a design and construction of a flexible experimental platform for quantum simulation and quantum metrology experiments. The goal was to create an experiment with the ability to support several research paradigms (high-precision measurement and investigation of quantum many-body systems).

During the design stage of the project, I became passionate about using my physics knowledge to gain experience in several engineering disciplines including experience in vacuum systems, machining, and optics design to successfully develop the experimental system. After completing the setup, I worked on the troubleshooting, testing and optimization of the system that resulted in our first experimental results. In the later stages of the experiment development, my focus was on continuing maintenance, while also working on a Python-based data analysis suite to analyze image-based data obtained from the experiment.
