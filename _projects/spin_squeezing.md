Entangled quantum states can be used as a resource in high-precision measurement devices, leading to improvements in atomic clock, metrology, and navigation technology. In this project, we demonstrated a new way of creating entangled states with advantages over other quantum-enhanced measurement techniques. Our approach was based on creating coherent interactions in groups of atoms by Rydberg dressing. 
The major focus of my work in this project was assessing sources of noise that affect the measurement and prevent us from creating the fragile quantum state. For this, I wrote a Monte-Carlo simulation to numerically simulate the loss processes in our system and built a simple model of super-Poissonian noise which was used to roughly assess what kind of loss process we have present in our system. Additionally, I worked on benchmarking and improving the experimental setup to be able to observe these states.
